        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A coffee drink with espresso, steamed milk and a layer of foam on top. It is similar to a latte and cappuccino, but has a thinner layer of foam on top. Modern coffee shops have very small differences between these three coffee drinks, and often times the lines are blurred.</p>
